## ðŸ“š Idea/Concept 
An artificial neural network is a computational and mathematical model inspired by the organization of the human brain, although without fully replicating it. It is composed of layers of artificial neurons (input, hidden, and output), where each neuron transforms its inputs through a weighted sum of values associated with weights and biases, followed by an activation function that introduces nonlinearity, allowing the modeling of complex relationships in the data.

Learning occurs through an iterative process in which the network compares its predictions with the actual values using a cost (or loss) function that quantifies the error. To minimize this error, the backpropagation algorithm is employed, together with optimization techniques such as gradient descent, which adjust the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the cost functionâ€™s gradient.
